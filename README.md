# Bangla-Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

Applying **logistic regression** and **Deep Neural network** for the **NumtaDB** dataset and build a multiclass classification model that can recognize `[0-9]` Bengali handwritten digits with different hyperparameter settings, we can see that Deep Neural Network Model gives better accuracy.
